# Nimculus Architecture

## Layers

```text
macOS platform (Cocoa / Metal / input)
              ↓
NimNUI platform contract and renderer
              ↓
Nimculus application layer
```

The macOS Objective-C implementation is isolated under
`src/nimnui/platform/macos`. Nim code communicates with it through the small
C ABI declared in `platform.h` and wrapped by `platform.nim`.

## M1 boundary

M1 provides a Cocoa window backed by `CAMetalLayer`, a Metal clear pass and
rectangle pass, Retina-aware drawable sizing, basic resize handling, and
keyboard/pointer/scroll input accounting. Editor state, text shaping, IME,
layout, and command routing are intentionally deferred to later milestones.
